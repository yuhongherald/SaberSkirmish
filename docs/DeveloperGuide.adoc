== About
Saber Skirmish is an arcade-style rail-shooter genre game, made in Unity 2018 2.8f Personal Edition.
Saber Skirmish was built for `Windows 8+` desktop and `Android 4.4+`, and is mainly written in `C#`.
This project is done by Yu Hong Herald and Yu Pei Henry under *CS3241R*, an exploratory
extension of a computer graphics module taught by Dr Alan Cheng from NUS.

Saber Skirmish features:

* *Interactive controls over a lightsaber.* Able to move lightsaber between 3 position, swing with 360 freedom along 1 axis (perpendicular to the ground).
* *Variety of enemies.* Some enemies will attack at close/far range. The player may deflect enemy missiles and fight melee or ranged against stormtroopers.
* *Challenging boss.* Challenge yourself against the final boss, Darth Vader. There is some simple AI mechanism behind the boss that defines his behavior.
* *Score mechanism.* Get assessed on your ability with a combo-driven scoring system. You will be awarded titles for 5k and 10k score (Padawan/Jedi Knight/Grandmaster).
* *Narration, sounds and music.* Enjoy storyline narration, sound effects and music.

To play the game, the player runs the server application on the desktop and the client application on the android phone.
Both devices must be connected to the same network. The player
then scans the generated QR code on the desktop to connect the devices. The application is built following the thin client - fat server model.

== Quickstart
This section is for new developers who want to build their game.

=== Phone client build
The current phone client build does not need to be modified. You can build the scene NewController for your
preferred mobile platform by going to File>Build Settings and following the illustration below.

=== Desktop server build
The game content is rendered on the server. To start developing the game, you will need to create a few GameObjects in the Editor:

[TIP]
You can use the structure provided in the example scene.

Events in the game are sequenced by `Scenes`, managed by the `SceneEngine`.
To change the sequence the scenes appear in the editor, you can reorder the scenes by selecting `SceneEngine`.

Scenes uses customizable assets. To change the assets used in each `Scene` in the editor, select the `Scene`,
then select the desired assets for the respective fields.

Music and voicing are managed by `MusicManager`. To change the music and voice clips used in the editor,
select `MusicManager`, then select the desired clips for the respective fields.

UI instructions are managed by `CollectiveInstructions`. To change the instructions shown in the editor,
select CollectiveInstructions, then select the desired instruction for the respective fields.

== Creating new classes
This section is for developers who are familiar with how to customize the game. Please see the section on quickstart to get familiarized.

=== Creating a new scene
To create a new Scene, you have to extend the `Scene` class to implement its behaviors.
Currently, there are 2 types of scenes, `Scene` and `LevelScene`. It is recommended to extend
`LevelScene` for levels and `Scene` for other types of Scenes.

Pay close attention to the scene’s status. For the scene to be integrated with the `SceneManager`,
it is important to update the status in `OpenScene` and `CloseScene`.

[source]
----
public override void OpenScene() {
	//…
	status = Status.Open; // or Status.Opening
}

public override void CloseScene() {
	//…
	status = Status.Close;
}
----

[TIP]
Remember to add `[SerializeField]` for fields that can be customized so that they will appear in the editor.

=== Creating new entities
To create a new entity, you have to extend the `AEntity` class to implement its behaviors.
Currently, there are are 2 types of entities, `AEntity` and `HealthBarEntity`. It is recommended to extend
`HealthBarEntity` for bosses, and `AEntity` for other types of enemies.

=== Creating new scene objects
Currently, the only scene object that has a behavior is the `Door`.

[TIP]
You can *refer* to the `Door` and `BlastDoor` class on how to create extendable scene objects.

=== Creating new instructions
An `ArcadeInsruction` is comprised of an `Instruction`, a `DirectionalArrow` and a `VirtualPhone`,
and they are all optional, depending on what you want to show.

`Instruction` is used to display animated text in the 3D scene, while `DirectionalArrow` and `VirtualPhone`
are used to signpost the player to carry out a certain action.

To create a new instruction, you have to create a new `Instruction`, `DirectionalArrow` and `VirtualPhone`
in the editor.

[TIP]
*Refer* to the instructions on adding the classes to the scene in the editor.

[TIP]
Remember to modify the enum class and Set method to integrate into the `CollectiveInstructions`.

[source]
----
public enum InstType {
//…
NEW_INST,
//...
}

public void SetInstruction(InstType type) {
	//…
	case(InstType.NEW_INST):
	SetInstruction(newInst);
	break;
	//...
}
----

=== Creating new music or voicing
To create new music or voicing, you have to add an `AudioSource` to your scene.

Step 1. Add an `AudioSource` to your scene. *Refer* to the instructions on adding the classes to the scene in the editor.

Step 2. Select the sound clip you want to play

Step 3. Set other properties such as volume, loop etc. in the inspector.

[TIP]
Remember to modify the enum class and Set method to integrate into the `MusicManager`.

[source]
----
public enum MUSIC {
//…
NEW_MUSIC,
//...
}

public enum SOUND {
//…
NEW_SOUND,
//...
}

public void SetMusic(MUSIC musicType) {
	//…
	case(MUSIC.NEW_MUSIC):
	SetMusic(newMusic);
	break;
	//...
}

public void SetMusic(VOICE voiceType) {
	//…
	case(VOICE.NEW_VOICE):
	SetMusic(newVoice);
	break;
	//...
}
----

== Adding the classes to the scene in the editor
This section is for developers who want to add custom classes into the scene.
For creating custom classes, *refer* to the previous section.

To add a class in the editor:

Step 1. Create an empty `GameObject` at your preferred location.

.Diagram of adding an empty GameObject
image::createEmptyObject.png[width="800"]

Step 2. Add your class as a component to the `GameObject`.

You should now be able to select the class in the editor fields. *Refer* to quickstart for more information.

== Project overview

image::architecture.png[width="800"]

Saber Skirmish is made of 4 main components: Scene, Connection, UI and Util.

* *Scene*: Contains classes that manage and represent objects in 3D space of the game.
* *Connection*: Contains classes that manage client-server connection.
* *UI*: Contains classes that draws and formats UI content.
* *Util*: Contains common methods for manipulating data types.

[appendix]
== Case study - Lightsaber escape

In this similar game, the player connects his mobile phone to an online server.
The player then interacts with the game by tilting the phone sideways to deflect lasers from stormtroopers.

Features:

* Smartphone controller
* Basic deflection combat mechanic

*Why Saber Skirmish*

* More control functionality - Moving between 3 positions and swinging, co-ordinated sounds, damage enemies only if sufficient velocity.
* More combat variation - Close/far range enemies have different killing requirements. Use of enemy spawn patterns and events to make level more exciting.
* Boss fight -  Complex enemy with more intelligent attacks.
* Score reward system - Players earn titles based on their in-game performance.
